                                            guidelines. Also, all of our foods

                                            Should the first can/dry combination
                                            not work for your pet, you can
                                            return the unused portions (50% or
                                            more remaining) in the original
                                            packaging for a full refund.

                                            seeking a vet’s care/suggestions for
                                            any pet that has potential medical
                                            issues before making any changes to
                                            your pet’s diet.
